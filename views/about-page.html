                    <p>What is PISA?

Created by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), PISA tests the skills and knowledge of 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics and science. Seventy-nine countries and economies took part in the 2018 assessment, which focused on reading, and the data were released by the OECD on 3rd December 2019.

Additional results on financial literacy, school organisation and global competence will be released in 2020.

What does PISA assess and why?

PISA focuses on the assessment of student performance in reading, mathematics and science because they are foundational to a student's ongoing education. PISA also collects valuable information on student attitudes and motivations, and formally assesses skills such as collaborative problem solving and global competence. It is also investigating opportunities to assess other important skills related, for example, to creative thinking.

PISA draws on content that can be found in curricula across the world and looks at students’ ability to apply knowledge and skills and to analyse, reason and communicate effectively as they examine, interpret and solve problems. PISA does not prescribe or promote any one curriculum nor is it constrained by the need to find common denominators. In 2018 the goal of PISA was to assess reading knowledge and skills that experts in the participating countries and economies consider to be most important for students’ full participation in knowledge-based societies that are increasingly reliant on digital technologies.

What are key features of PISA 2018?

Content: The  PISA  2018  survey  focused  on  reading,  with  mathematics,  science  and  global  competence  as  minor  areas  of assessment. PISA 2018 also included an assessment of young people’s financial literacy, which was optional for countries and economies.

Students: Some 600 000 students completed the assessment in 2018, representing about 32 million 15-year-olds in the schools of the 79 participating countries and economies.

Tests:  Computer-based tests were used in most countries, with assessments lasting a total of two hours. In reading, a multi-stage adaptive approach was applied in computer-based tests whereby students were assigned a block of test items based on their performance in preceding blocks.  Students also answered a background questionnaire, which took about 35 minutes to complete. Test  items  were  a  mixture  of  multiple-choice  questions  and  questions  requiring  students  to  construct  their  own responses. The items were organised into groups based on a passage of text describing a real-life situation. More than 15 hours of test items for reading, mathematics, science and global competence were covered, with different students taking different combinations of test items.

Questionnaires: The questionnaire sought  information  about  the  students  themselves,  their  attitudes,  dispositions  and  beliefs,  their  homes,  and  their school and learning experiences. School principals completed a questionnaire that covered school management and organisation, and the learning environment.  Some  countries/economies  also  distributed  additional  questionnaires  to  elicit  more  information.  These  included:  in 19 countries/economies, a questionnaire for teachers asking about themselves and their teaching practices; and in 17  countries/economies, a questionnaire for parents asking them to provide information about their perceptions of and involvement in their child’s school and learning. Countries/economies could also choose to distribute three other optional questionnaires for students: 52 countries/economies distributed a questionnaire about students’ familiarity with computers; 32 countries/economies distributed a questionnaire about students’ expectations for further education; and 9 countries/economies distributed a questionnaire, developed for PISA 2018, about students’ well-being.

See further information in a section of What is PISA in Volume I of the PISA 2018 Results [A link to the publication will be available on 3 December 2019]. How are PISA results related to adult life outcomes?

Four countries – Australia, Canada, Denmark and Switzerland – have conducted longitudinal studies that followed the cohort of students who sat the first PISA assessments in the early 2000s through their transition into adulthood. Across all of these countries, students who performed better in PISA at age 15 were more likely to attain higher levels of education by the age of 25. They were also less likely to be out of the labour market entirely, as measured by the percentage of students who were not in education, employment or training (NEET).

Of course, there is a link between the socio-economic status of a student’s household – including material living conditions and parents’ educational attainment – and the student’s performance in PISA. However, even after accounting for these factors, students who perform better in PISA at age 15 have stronger education and employment outcomes at the age of 25. In addition, what students say about themselves in the PISA questionnaires also appears related to young people’s future life prospects. For further details, please see the November 2019 PISA in Focus and the report Equity in Education.

What is new in PISA 2018?

A new framework for the reading assessment was developed to reflect changes since 2009 – the most recent year in which reading was the main subject of assessment in PISA and the last time that the reading framework was updated – in what and how people read. In particular, over the past decade, reading has increasingly moved onto electronic formats and there has been a proliferation of the amount of material available to read. As a result, the PISA 2018 reading assessment placed greater emphasis on the ability to find, compare, contrast and integrate information across multiple sources of text.

Adaptive testing was implemented in the reading assessment. Students who performed well on earlier parts of the reading assessment were more likely to receive more difficult questions later in the assessment. Conversely, students who performed poorly in earlier parts of the assessment were more likely to receive easier questions later in the assessment.

Global competence was tested for the first time in PISA 2018; results for this subject will be published in late 2020.

Several countries also participated in PISA for the first time: Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brunei Darussalam, Morocco, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine. For further details, please see the October 2019 PISA in Focus and the PISA 2018 Assessment and Analytical Framework.

Whom does PISA assess?

PISA assesses students between the ages of 15 years and 3 months and 16 years and 2 months, and who are enrolled in an educational institution at grade 7 or higher. The lists from which schools and students are selected for the PISA assessment cover all students who meet these criteria, regardless of the type of educational institution in which they are enrolled and whether they are enrolled in full-time or part-time education.

However, some of the schools and students that are listed may be excluded from PISA samples. PISA standards specify that such exclusions should not represent more than 5% of the target population. Within that limit, students can be excluded for various reasons, including the remoteness and inaccessibility of their school, intellectual or physical disability, a lack of proficiency in the test language (e.g. if the student has received instruction in the test language for less than one year), or a lack of test material in the language of instruction. For countries where the overall level of exclusions exceeds the limit significantly, further information is requested to support the case that no bias in comparisons over time and with other countries would result from exclusions.

Except in very small countries and economies, not all remaining students sit the PISA assessment; rather, a sample of schools, and of students within schools, is drawn, and the students selected are assigned sampling weights so as to represent the entire PISA-eligible cohort.

The demographic composition of the PISA sample may change over time, reflecting, for example, changes in enrolment rates or migration flows. These changes can also affect the interpretation of trends. To support the correct interpretation of trends, PISA discusses major contextual changes alongside trends in performance. It presents adjusted trends that account for changes in the student population in addition to the basic, non-adjusted performance trends.

Further information about the PISA target population for individual countries can be found in Chapter 3 and in Annex A2 of PISA 2018 Results (Volume I) [A link to the publication will be available on 3 December 2019].

How many 15-year-olds does the PISA sample represent?

The PISA sample represents all students between the age of 15 years and 3 months and 16 years and 2 months, and who are enrolled in an educational institution at grade 7 or higher, minus those that are excluded. PISA reports the proportion of the total 15-year-old population that is represented by the PISA sample (this is known as Coverage Index 3). This proportion ranges from close to 100% in countries with limited exclusions and universal enrolment in educational institutions for 15-16-year-olds, to less than 50% in some low- and middle-income countries. In most participating countries and economies, more than 80% of 15-year-olds are covered.

Coverage of the 15-year-old cohort has increased in many countries since earlier PISA assessments. For example, between 2003 and 2018, Indonesia added almost 1.8 million students, and Mexico and Turkey more than 400 000 students, to the total population of 15-year-olds eligible to participate in PISA. Uruguay and Brazil also increased the number of 15-year-olds eligible to participate in PISA, despite having a smaller population of 15-year-olds in 2018 than in 2003.

Further information about the share and number of 15-year-olds covered by PISA can be found in Chapter 3 and in Annex A2 of PISA 2018 Results (Volume I).[A link to the publication will be available on 3 December 2019].

Why does PISA test 15-year-olds?

The age of 15 was chosen because at this age young people in most OECD countries are nearing the end of compulsory education. The selection of schools and students is as inclusive as possible, so that the sample of students comes from a broad range of backgrounds and abilities.

What makes PISA unique?

PISA benefits from its worldwide scope and its regularity. More than 90 countries and economies have taken part in PISA so far and the surveys, which are carried out every three years, allow participating countries and economies to track their progress in meeting key learning goals. PISA is the only international education survey to measure the knowledge and skills of 15-year-olds.

PISA is also unique in the way it looks at:

Public policy issues: Governments, principals, teachers and parents all want answers to questions such as, "Are our schools adequately preparing young people for the challenges of adult life?", "Are some kinds of teaching and schools more effective than others?" and, "Can schools contribute to improving the futures of students from immigrant or disadvantaged backgrounds?"
Literacy: Rather than examine mastery of specific school curricula, PISA looks at students’ ability to apply knowledge and skills in key subject areas and to analyse, reason and communicate effectively as they examine, interpret and solve problems.
Lifelong learning: Students cannot learn everything they need to know in school. In order to be effective lifelong learners, young people need not only knowledge and skills, but also an awareness of why and how they learn. PISA both measures student performance in reading, mathematics and science literacy, and asks students about their motivations, beliefs about themselves and learning strategies.
How do I find out more about the PISA assessment and who develops it?

Through its website and publications, the OECD makes available to the public and specialists all the key information on the methods and processes associated with PISA. The following documents are available on the Publications page and the Data page: the assessment frameworks that explain what is to be assessed, why and how; examples of the questionnaire items; the data from the assessment; the survey-implementation tools for administration and language-quality assurance; and a comprehensive technical report for every cycle, which includes detailed technical information on every aspect of assessment and analysis.

For each assessment cycle a selection of PISA test materials is also made available to the general public. In order to allow countries to follow their performance over time, many questions are used in more than one PISA survey. These questions cannot be made public as long as they are in use.

In addition to OECD staff and contractors, hundreds of experts, academics and researchers in PISA-participating countries and economies are involved in PISA's development, analysis and reporting; details of these participants are provided in the PISA reports.</p>
